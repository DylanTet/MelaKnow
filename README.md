A simple application where users can take photos of moles or freckles to have them scanned and check if they are cancerous or not from their phones. 

TODO:
    - Look into possible ways to cache the photos in the users library so we're not loading from phone storage every render
    - Start implementing model into project
    - What data will be going onto the home screen?
    - Update camera screen to help user take accurate pictures
